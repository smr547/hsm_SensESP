## Source code directory

Note that most of the code in this directory is generated using the 
[QM modelling tool](https://www.state-machine.com/products/qm) from 
Quantum Leaps 

* CMakeLists.txt
* main.cpp  -- generated by qm tool from the model file ``qhsmtst.qm``
* qep_hsm.cpp -- symbolic link to the hsm support code in the qp package
* qhsmtst.cpp  -- generated by qm tool from the model file ``qhsmtst.qm``
* qhsmtst.hpp  -- generated by qm tool from the model file ``qhsmtst.qm``
* qhsmtst.qm  -- the model file
* qhsmtst.qms -- not sure what this is
* qp_config.hpp  -- generated by qm tool from the model file ``qhsmtst.qm``

For the time being, all of these files are checked into ``git``
